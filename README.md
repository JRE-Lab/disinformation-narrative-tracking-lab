# Disinformation & Narrative Tracking Lab

This repository contains materials for a disinformation and narrative tracking lab. The lab teaches you how to collect posts, articles, and fact-checks across multiple platforms, map the spread of a specific narrative, and assess its intent and potential impact.

## Overview

You will:

- Define a disinformation narrative to track across languages and platforms.
- Use OSINT tools and scrapers to collect posts, articles, and fact checks.
- Build a propagation graph of the narrative using network analysis libraries.
- Evaluate likely intent, deception indicators, and alternative explanations.
- Document key judgments, confidence levels, and collection gaps.

All data used in this lab comes from publicly available sources and is used for research and educational purposes only.
